To run the program:
1. Go to the folder where 'DrawingBoard.jar' is located.
2. Run the following command: java -jar DrawingBoard.jar

To run tests:
1. Go to folder 'DrawingBoard' where 'pom.xml' is located.
2. Run the following command: mvn test


Assumptions:
1. Commands will be entered one by one.
2. In the case of Rectangle command R, if (x1, y1) is to the right and bottom of (x2, y2), the rectangle would be created with (x2, y2) as upper left and (x1, y1) as lower right corner.


Commands:

Command 		Description
C w h           Should create a new canvas of width w and height h.
L x1 y1 x2 y2   Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only
                horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines
                will be drawn using the 'x' character.
R x1 y1 x2 y2   Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and
                lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn
                using the 'x' character.
B x y c         Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "colour" c. The
                behavior of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint
                programs.
Q               Should quit the program.
